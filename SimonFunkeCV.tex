\sectionheader{Research Interest/Research Profile }
%Provide an â€˜abstractâ€™, no more than a short paragraph, which outlines your current and
%prospective lines of research.

Funke's research interests center around optimisation problems governed by
partial differential equations, with a focus on their numerical solution. In
particular, he is interested in the automated derivation of adjoint and tangent
linear models and their use in optimal control, data inversion and design optimisation.
He is a founder of the dolfin-adjoint project, a software which automatically
derives adjoint models from complex computer models solving partial
differential equations based on a high-level symbolic problem specification
language that mimics mathematical notation.

Funke applies these advances to applications in a wide variety of different
domains including renewable energy and bioengineering. For the renewable energy
sector, he developed OpenTidalFarm, an open-source software for optimising of
tidal turbine farms, such as the optimal position of turbines within the farm.
In bioengineering, he developes data assimilation techniques for blood flow
simulations, with the aim to tune high-fidelity numerical blood flow models to
match with MRI measurements.
